# StartUp Research - Alan Gelfand research group

[StartUp Research](http://www.congressi.unisi.it/startupresearch/) is a 2-day meeting where small research groups of young scholars, advised by senior researchers with a well-established experience in different areas of Statistics, will be asked to develop innovative methods and models to analyze a common dataset, with the goal of answering scientific questions arising from an applied problem. 

This repository contains the work of the research group composed by:

* *Alessia Caponera*, Sapienza University of Rome
* *Francesco Denti*, University of Milan-Bicocca
* *Tommaso Rigon*, Bocconi University
* *Andrea Sottosanti*, University of Padua

under the supervision of [Alan Gelfand](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~alan/), James B. Duke Professor of Statistical Science at Duke University and Professor of Environmental Science and Policy in the Nicholas School. 

# Outline of the project

Before the meeting we started to collect general impression about the data, which are summarized [in a pdf document](https://github.com/tommasorigon/StartUpResearch/blob/master/Descriptive_Analysis.pdf). We planned to fit progressively many different models, which are explained [in this document (not available yet!)]().

## Single subject, single hemisphere

### Model 1

The first model we estimated is an additive model, in which the spatial and the temporal dimension enters in the predictor additively. In the [`Model1.md`](https://github.com/tommasorigon/StartUpResearch/blob/master/Models/Model1.md) file we summarized our findings.

### Model 2

## Multiple subjects, single hemisphere
